<p>Regression Discontinuity Design (RDD) ist ein Ansatz für die Schätzung von Treatment-Effekten mit Regression, wenn durch einen experimentell oder natürlich gegebenen Umstand die Behandlung an einem Schwellenwert (<span class="math inline">\(C\)</span>) einer <em>Laufvariable</em> (<span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>) sprunghaft beeinflusst wird. Ein RDD-Schätzer brücksichtigt lediglich Beobachtungen mit Ausprägungen von <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>, die knapp ober- oder knapp unterhalb von <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> liegen. Die zentrale Idee hierbei ist, dass Individuen nahe bei <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> im Durchschnitt ähnliche Merkmale aufweisen. RDD isoliert Variation auf dem Pfad <em>Oberhalb C → Treatment → Y</em>. Somit können Backdoor-Pfade über <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> oder weitere (möglichweise unbeobachtbare) Confounder (<span class="math inline">\(Z\)</span>) vermieden werden, siehe <a href="#fig-CDRDD">Abbildung&nbsp;<span>2.1</span></a>.</p>

<p>Der kausale Effekt wird dabei als durchschnittlicher Effekt der Diskontinuität auf die Outcome-Variable (<span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>) anhand von Beobachtungen <em>nahe bei <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span></em> ermittelt.</p>
<p>Hinsichtlich der Beeinflussung der Behandlung unterscheiden wir zwischen <em>Sharp</em> und <em>Fuzzy</em> Regression Discontinuity Designs (SRDD/FRDD). Bei einem SRDD ist die Zuordnung <em>deterministisch</em>, d.h. der Schwellenwert in der Laufvariable ist eine harte Grenze für die Gruppenzugehörigkeit: Die <em>Wahrscheinlichkeit</em> der Behandlung springt bei <span class="math inline">\(X=C\)</span> um <span class="math inline">\(p=100\%\)</span>.</p>
<div class="page-columns page-full"><p>Bei einem FRDD wird angenommen, dass die Zuordnung nicht perfekt durch den Schwellenwert C bestimmt ist: Die <em>Wahrscheinlichkeit</em> der Behandlung springt bei <span class="math inline">\(X=C\)</span> um <span class="math inline">\(p&lt;100\%\)</span>.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> Dies tritt auf, wenn das Überschreiten von <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> nicht die einzige Determinante einer Behandlung ist. Die Wahl zwischen SRDD und FRDD hängt von der Natur der Daten und der Forschungsfrage ab.</p><div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><li id="fn1"><p><sup>1</sup>&nbsp;Im FRDD können also sowohl Treatment- als auch Kontroll-Beobachtungen auf beiden Seiten der Diskontinuität beobachtet werden – die Trennung der Gruppen ist “unscharf” (engl. <em>fuzzy</em>)</p></li></div></div>

<p><strong>Modelle und funktionale Form</strong></p>
<p>Die korrekte Spezifikation der funktionalen Form für RDD ist wichtig, um eine unverzerrte Schätzung des Effekts zu vermeiden. Die einfachste Form eines SRDD kann anhand der linearen Regression <span class="math display">\[\begin{align}
Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 D_i + \beta_2 (X_i - C) + u_i\label{eq-simpleSRDD}
\end{align}\]</span> geschätzt werden, wobei <span class="math inline">\(D_i\)</span> Behandlung anzeigt: <span class="math inline">\(D_i\)</span> ist eine Dummy-Variable für das Überschreiten des Schwellenwertes C, d.h. <span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
  D_i=\begin{cases}
    0 &amp; X_i &lt; C\\
    1 &amp; X_i \geq C.
  \end{cases}
\end{align*}\]</span> Hierbei ist zu beachten, dass <span class="math inline">\((X_i - C)\)</span> die um den Schwellenwert zentrierte Laufvariable ist, sodass <span class="math inline">\(\beta_1\)</span> der Effekt der Behandlung bei <span class="math inline">\((X_i - C)\geq 0\)</span> ist.</p>
<p>Modell <span class="math inline">\(\eqref{eq-simpleSRDD}\)</span> unterstellt, dass <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> links- und rechtsseitig von <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> denselben Effekt <span class="math inline">\(\beta_2\)</span> auf <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> hat. Eine Alternative ist ein lineares Interaktionsmodell <span class="math display">\[\begin{align}
Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 D_i + \beta_2 (X_i - C) + \beta_3(X_i-C)\times D_i + u_i.\label{eq:linearSRDD}
\end{align}\]</span> In Modell <span class="math inline">\(\eqref{eq:linearSRDD}\)</span> erfasst <span class="math inline">\(\beta_3\)</span> den Unterschied des Effekts von <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> auf <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> für Beoabachtungen oberhalb von <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> gegenüber Beobachtungen unterhalb von <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span>, sodass unterschiedliche lineare Effekte von <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> auf <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> link- und rechtsseitig von <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> modelliert werden können.</p>
<p><strong>Bandweite</strong></p>
<div class="page-columns page-full"><p>Neben der funktionalen Form muss spezifiziert werden, welche Beobachtungen hinreichend nahe am Schwellenwert C liegen. Hierfür verwenden wir eine sogenannte Bandweite <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span>, wobei <span class="math display">\[\begin{align}
  \lvert(X_i-C)\rvert\leq h \label{eq:bwc}
\end{align}\]</span> das Kriterium für eine Berücksichtigung von Beobachtung <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> bei der Schätzung ist. Unter Berücksichtigung einer Bandweite <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span> wird der Regressionsansatz <span class="math inline">\(\eqref{eq:linearSRDD}\)</span> als <em>local linear regression</em> mit Uniform-Kernelfunktion bezeichnet.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> Der Uniform-Kernel ist neben dem Triangular-Kernel eine häufig in der Praxis genutzte lineare Kernelfunktion.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> Der nachstehende Code plottet die Uniform- (grün) sowie die Triangular-Kernelfunktion (blau) wie in <a href="#fig-linearkern">Abbildung&nbsp;<span>2.2</span></a> dargestellt.</p><div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><li id="fn2"><p><sup>2</sup>&nbsp;<em>Local regression</em> ist ein nicht-parametrisches Verfahren.

<p>Die Wahl der Bandweite ist eine wichtige Komponente der RDD-Schätzung. Falls der wahre Zusammenhang nicht-linear ist, erlauben kleine Bandweiten eine Schätzung der Regressionsfunktion nahe des Schwellenwertes mit wenig Verzerrung. Allerdings kann diese Schätzung unpräzise sein, wenn nur wenige Beobachtungen <span class="math inline">\(\eqref{eq:bwc}\)</span> erfüllen. In der Praxis wird <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span> daher anhand einer Schätzfunktion <span class="citation" data-cites="ImbensKalyanaraman2012">(<a href="Literatur.html#ref-ImbensKalyanaraman2012" role="doc-biblioref">G. Imbens und Kalyanaraman 2012</a>)</span> oder anhand von <em>Cross Validation</em> <span class="citation" data-cites="ImbensLemieux2008">(bspw. <a href="Literatur.html#ref-ImbensLemieux2008" role="doc-biblioref">G. W. Imbens und Lemieux 2008</a>)</span> bestimmt. Die später in diesem Kapitel betrachteten R-Pakete halten diese Methoden bereit.</p>

</h3>
<p><span class="citation" data-cites="Lee2008">Lee (<a href="Literatur.html#ref-Lee2008" role="doc-biblioref">2008</a>)</span> untersucht den Einfluss des Amtsinhaber-Vorteils auf die Wahl von Mitgliedern des US-Repräsentantenhauses. Entfällt ein Stimmenanteil von mehr als 50% auf eine Partei, hat diese Partei den Vorsitz des Repräsentantenhauses gewonnen. Durch die Analyse der 6558 Wahlen im Zeitraum 1946-1998 mit RDD kommt die Studie zu dem Ergebnis, dass die amtsinhabende im Durchschnitt einen Vorteil von etwa 8%-10% bei der Wahl hat. Dieses Ergebnis kann als Vorteil kann durch verschiedene Faktoren erklärt werden, bspw. dass die amtierende Partei höhere finanzielle Ressourcen und von einer besseren Organisation als die Opposition profitiert. Anhand der Datensätze <code>house</code> und <code>house_binned</code> illustrieren wir nachfolgend die Schätzung von SRDD-Modellen für den Wahlerfolg der demokratischen Partei, wenn diese Amtsinhaber ist.</p>
<p>Wir verschaffen uns zunächst einen Überblick über den Datensatz <code>house</code>.</p>

Weiterhin erkennen wir, dass der Zusammenhang nahe 0 jeweils gut durch eine lineare Funktion approximiert werden kann.

<p>Die Studie <em>Beyond Work Ethic: Religion, Individual, and Political Preferences</em> <span class="citation" data-cites="BastenBetz2013">(<a href="Literatur.html#ref-BastenBetz2013" role="doc-biblioref"><strong>BastenBetz2013?</strong></a>)</span> untersucht den Zusammenhang zwischen Religion, individuellen Merkmalen und politischen Präferenzen. Das Hauptaugenmerk ist die Rolle von Religiosität als Einflussfaktor auf politische Einstellungen. Die Hypothese ist, das Religiosität eines Individuums über den traditionellen Rahmen von Moralvorstellungen und sozialen Normen hinaus auch politische Präferenzen beeinflusst. Diese Theorie wird prominent von Max Weber (1930) vertreten, der argumentiert, dass die protestantische Arbeitsethik einen entscheidenden Einfluss auf die Entwicklung des Kapitalismus hatte. Laut Weber führte der protestantische Glaube an harte Arbeit, ein sparsames Leben und ethisches Verhalten zur einer verbreiteten “Geisteshaltung” , die den wirtschaftlichen Erfolg förderte und den Aufstieg des Kapitalismus begünstigte.</p>
<p><span class="citation" data-cites="BastenBetz2013">(<a href="Literatur.html#ref-BastenBetz2013" role="doc-biblioref"><strong>BastenBetz2013?</strong></a>)</span> nutzen Daten aus dem World Values Survey,</p>
<p>Sie analysieren insbesondere die Zusammenhänge zwischen Religiosität, individuellen Merkmalen wie Geschlecht, Bildung und Einkommen sowie politischen Präferenzen wie links-rechts-Ausrichtung, Einstellungen zur Umverteilung und zur Einwanderung.</p>
<p>Die Ergebnisse der Studie zeigen, dass Religiosität tatsächlich einen signifikanten Einfluss auf politische Präferenzen hat. Insbesondere stellen die Autoren fest, dass religiöse Menschen tendenziell konservativere Einstellungen haben und eher rechten politischen Parteien zuneigen. Dieser Effekt bleibt auch nach Kontrolle anderer Faktoren wie Bildung und Einkommen bestehen.</p>
<p>Darüber hinaus betonen die Autoren, dass der Zusammenhang zwischen Religion und politischen Präferenzen nicht allein durch moralische Werte erklärt werden kann. Sie argumentieren, dass religiöse Institutionen auch eine soziale und politische Agenda verfolgen, die von den Gläubigen internalisiert wird. Diese Agenda kann beispielsweise Positionen zu Themen wie Abtreibung, gleichgeschlechtlicher Ehe, Einwanderung oder Umweltschutz umfassen.</p>
<p>Zusammenfassend zeigt das Paper “Beyond Work Ethic: Religion, Individual, and Political Preferences” von Christoph Basten und Frank Betz, dass Religiosität einen Einfluss auf politische Präferenzen hat, der über traditionelle Moralvorstellungen hinausgeht. Es deutet darauf hin, dass religiöse Menschen eher konservative politische Ansichten haben und dass religiöse Institutionen eine Rolle bei der Formulierung dieser Ansichten spielen können.</p>
